                    <p>I am considering the possibility of working as a development manager and as a simple developer. But only remotely.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>PHP developer remotely - from $ 2500 per month. Only to an English-speaking company.</h3>
                    <p>What you get: an employee who just needs to voice the requirements and get the optimal result, who does not need to be monitored and trained, who calculates the deadlines for a maximum of +/- 10%, who will "enter" your project in two or three days and start issuing a code. Who does not thump, does not smoke, monitors his health and does not "burn out". He calmly talks about problems, does not disappear, always strives for a reasonable compromise.</p>
                    <p>Loyalty to the immediate supervisor - I know what subordination is and I will not show my leadership skills without a direct request. I will have to negotiate with me, did the interaction "on the shore", but then I will strictly observe the agreements. My word is dear.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Leading PHP developer remotely to a Russian-speaking company - from $ 3000 per month.</h3>
                    <p>What you get: the same as in the previous paragraph + plus very fast start</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Team lead - from $ 3500 per month.</h3>
                    <p>What we get: an experienced employee who knows how to establish a clear team work, taking into account the specifics of the project, management, employees. Personnel reserve for the head of the department, if necessary</p>
                    <p>What we don't get: a lover of corporate intrigue, a licker of appropriate places, a "manipulator" and a holder "in the black body of subordinates" - if this is actively practiced in the organization, I will immediately leave as soon as I understand this. My style of a middle manager is "Servant to the Tsar, Father to Soldiers" - you should not count on more.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Development manager, technical director - from $ 5000 per month.</h3>
                    <p>What we get: the same as the team lead + the presence of a remote team of 3-4 middle-level people + an extra-class admin, which I can assemble, if necessary, quickly enough</p>
